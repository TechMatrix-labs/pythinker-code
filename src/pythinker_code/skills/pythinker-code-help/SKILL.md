# Pythinker CLI Help

Help users with Pythinker CLI questions by consulting documentation and source code.

## Strategy

1. **Prefer official documentation** for most questions
2. **Read local source** when in pythinker-code project itself, or when user is developing with pythinker-code as a library (e.g., importing from `pythinker_code` in their code)
3. **Clone and explore source** for complex internals not covered in docs - **ask user for confirmation first**

## Documentation

Base URL: `https://mohamed-elkholy95.github.io/Pythinker-Code/`

Fetch documentation index to find relevant pages:

```
https://mohamed-elkholy95.github.io/Pythinker-Code/llms.txt
```

### Page URL Pattern

- Pages: `https://mohamed-elkholy95.github.io/Pythinker-Code/en/...`

### Topic Mapping

| Topic | Page |
|-------|------|
| Installation, first run | `/en/guides/getting-started.md` |
| Config files | `/en/configuration/config-files.md` |
| Providers, models | `/en/configuration/providers.md` |
| Environment variables | `/en/configuration/env-vars.md` |
| Slash commands | `/en/reference/slash-commands.md` |
| CLI flags | `/en/reference/pythinker-command.md` |
| Keyboard shortcuts | `/en/reference/keyboard.md` |
| MCP | `/en/customization/mcp.md` |
| Agents | `/en/customization/agents.md` |
| Skills | `/en/customization/skills.md` |
| FAQ | `/en/faq.md` |

## Source Code

Repository: `https://github.com/mohamed-elkholy95/Pythinker-Code`

When to read source:

- In pythinker-code project directory (check `pyproject.toml` for `name = "pythinker-code"`)
- User is importing `pythinker_code` as a library in their project
- Question about internals not covered in docs (ask user before cloning)
