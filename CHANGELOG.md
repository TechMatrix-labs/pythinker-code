# Changelog

All notable changes to `pythinker-code` are tracked in this file.

Pythinker Code uses a `0.MINOR.PATCH` version scheme. `MINOR` is a release
counter that continues advancing with each release. `PATCH` is reserved for
hotfixes against an already-released `MINOR`. There is no `1.0.0` milestone
planned on this line.

Releases earlier than `0.8.0` were published as `pythinker-code` 1.x/2.x
under a different scheme. The full pre-`0.8.0` history is preserved in
[`docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md`](docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md).
All 1.x and 2.x releases have been yanked from PyPI and removed from the
GitHub Releases page; `0.8.0` is the new starting line.

## Unreleased

## 0.24.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Update prompt is now wired and highlighted.** The blocking 4-choice update menu (Update now / Skip / Dismiss / Exit) was defined but never invoked at shell startup — users only ever saw the passive bottom-bar toast. It now runs before the auto-update path in every interactive session. The persistent status-line update notice also renders in bold bright-yellow so it is harder to miss.
- **Complete native installer `Fetch` fix.** The 0.23.0 release bundled trafilatura's data files but missed `justext`'s stoplists directory, so the `Fetch` tool still crashed with `FileNotFoundError: ./_MEIxxxx/justext/stoplists` on `.exe`, `.deb`, and `.rpm` installs. All three installer specs now bundle both `trafilatura` and `justext` data files. PyPI / `pip install` was unaffected.
- **Atomic "latest" release gating.** The GitHub Release is no longer marked "latest" until every platform asset (4 archives, 1 `.exe`, 4 `.deb`/`.rpm`) is attached. A dispatch workflow polls for completeness before flipping the flag, so `/releases/latest` and the in-app updater no longer serve a partially-built release during the publish window.
- **Smarter `/update` command.** `run_update_prompt` now routes through `do_update(check_only=True)` to get a fresh PyPI version before showing the update modal, and verifies that the expected binary asset for your platform exists on the GitHub Release before initiating a native upgrade.
- **Repository transferred to TechMatrix-labs.** All GitHub URLs, install script references, and CI configuration now point to `github.com/TechMatrix-labs/pythinker-code`.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.24.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.23.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Fetch tool works again in native installers.** The PyInstaller-built `pythinker` binaries (Homebrew, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `PythinkerSetup-*.exe`) shipped without `trafilatura/settings.cfg`, so the first `Fetch` call against any non-empty page crashed with `No option 'min_extracted_size' in section: 'DEFAULT'` as trafilatura tried to read an empty `ConfigParser`. The PyInstaller datas tuple now collects trafilatura's data files, so the bundled binary's `Fetch` tool extracts page content as expected. PyPI / `pip` installs were unaffected.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.23.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.22.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Reliable update banner.** The auto-update check no longer skips when prompt_toolkit wraps stdout (the incorrect `isatty()` guard is gone), and the 24-hour throttle is now armed only after a successful round-trip — transient first-launch failures no longer silence the banner for a day. The blocking pre-start update prompt is removed; the bottom-bar toast is the sole update UI.
- **Lighter GitHub releases polling.** Update checks send `If-None-Match` with the cached ETag and serve `304 Not Modified` from disk, so shared-NAT users no longer burn unauthenticated rate limit on every launch.
- **Robust Windows upgrade flow.** The detached upgrade helper is launched as a single base64 `-EncodedCommand` PowerShell call, eliminating quote leakage through `cmd.exe`/`CommandLineToArgvW` that had been printing `Wait-Process …` as a literal string. The non-PowerShell installer fallback now sets `close_fds=True` so the running `pythinker.exe` handle is no longer inherited and locked against replacement.
- **Always-clean upgrade staging.** Linux and macOS native upgrades wrap the post-`mkdtemp` work in `try`/`finally` so the staging tmpdir is removed on every exit, including failures (Windows continues to delegate cleanup to the detached helper).

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.22.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.21.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Non-blocking memory recall.** Recall I/O is now dispatched to a thread-pool executor, preventing the event loop from stalling during memory lookups. Sessions with large memory stores or slow disks will remain responsive throughout recall.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.21.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.20.0 (2026-05-28)

### What changed in this release

- **Ranked recall injection and Scratchpad working memory.** The memory subsystem gains a dependency-free lexical retriever, ranked recall injection replacing the previous verbatim memory dump, and a new root-only `Scratchpad` tool that lets the agent record structured notes across tool calls during a session.
- **Full memory lifecycle: Phases B–D.** A unified injection bus re-arms recall on every Memory or Scratchpad write (Phase B), session-end episodic recaps are harvested before compaction into a per-project journal (Phase C, off by default), and an approval-gated inbox consolidation flow (`/memory inbox`) proposes—but never auto-applies—memory merges (Phase D).
- **Context-aware and web-fresh agent subagents.** Code-reviewer, security-reviewer, coder, and plan specialists now mandate a context7-first / web-fallback freshness check before scoring third-party findings or writing against a library. The system prompt gains a Granular Todo discipline (one in-progress sub-todo per dispatched subagent) and an Engineering Discipline section.
- **Memory robustness hardening.** Compaction harvest failures are now isolated per-phase (a broken prepare step no longer silently cancels recall), inbox JSON-parse errors log and skip instead of dropping silently, and the recall injection bus uses a knapsack budget that continues filling with lower-priority candidates after a high-priority slot overflows.
- **Animated robot logo in all native installers.** The curl-bash and PowerShell native installers now display a Tetris-style animated robot-head logo on supported terminals, with a static fallback for CI, `NO_COLOR`, dumb-term, or `PYTHINKER_NO_ANIMATION=1`.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.20.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.19.0 (2026-05-27)

### What changed in this release

- **Central per-project agent memory.** Pythinker now keeps a durable per-project memory (`MEMORY.md` / `USER.md`) under `~/.pythinker/projects/<key>/memory/`, written through a new root-only `Memory` tool with content guards and secret-shape detection, recalled into the root agent's first wakeup prompt within a bounded budget, and inspectable with the new `/memory` command.
- **Non-blocking update flow.** The blocking pre-start update prompt is replaced by a cached, no-network startup notice plus a triggerable `/update` command, and the native Windows installer now waits on the launching process before swapping files and cleans up its staged installer.
- **Fully native Homebrew formula.** Brew installs are generated from the same GitHub Release tarballs as the curl installer (including macOS Intel native assets), so they no longer depend on PyPI virtualenv resources.
- **Release pipeline hardening.** TestPyPI publishing is now non-blocking and publish steps carry timeouts, so a transient staging flake no longer fails a release.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.19.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.18.0 (2026-05-27)

### What changed in this release

- **Live subagent activity streaming.** Subagent tool calls now stream live into the transcript, with safe pending headers for in-flight tool calls, new transcript progress events, and a unified shimmer animation across active-work labels so long-running exploration stays legible.
- **Smarter delegation and orchestration.** A Context-First Orchestration Protocol guides the default agent, specialist subagents receive prompt packets for single-objective delegation plus evidence and verification gates, and overflow RunAgents children are deferred instead of hard-failing.
- **Calmer, more resilient TUI.** In-flight and singular Ask payloads no longer flash an invalid badge, MCP startup status is cleaner, and shell rendering and MCP guidance are refined.
- **Sturdier configuration handling.** Incompatible legacy JSON config is now preserved instead of being silently reset to defaults.
- **Security and shell hardening.** The security scan and shell execution paths were hardened against unexpected input.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.18.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.17.0 (2026-05-25)

### What changed in this release

- **Sharper compaction continuity.** PreCompact now carries custom instructions, restores skill and hook context after compaction, triggers SessionStart after restore, and preserves the `Conversation compacted.` handoff so long sessions resume cleanly.
- **Better subagent orchestration.** Subagent specs merge inherited subagent maps, foreground and background launches preserve parent-agent IDs for spawn-tree tracking, RunAgents fingerprints include agent names, and markdown agent discovery warns on unknown models instead of silently falling back.
- **Polished terminal workflow.** The shell adopts the robot-brand palette, compact transcript/agent/file-mention menus, pinned live todo activity, calmer tool output, safer auto-backgrounding for long shell commands, and updated render snapshots.
- **Release and installer hardening.** Interactive sessions show a blocking pre-start update prompt, update exits wait for acknowledgement, Homebrew publish retries package installs, and native installers gain a friendlier animated path with Windows User PATH automation.
- **Provider compatibility refresh.** Anthropic SDK support is updated for 0.101 tool-result block types so direct Anthropic sessions continue to stream tool output correctly.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.17.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.16.0 (2026-05-24)

### What changed in this release

- **Standardized native install docs across platforms.** README Quick Start now presents one canonical Windows command (`irm https://pythinker.com/install.ps1 | iex`) and one canonical macOS/Linux command (`curl -fsSL https://pythinker.com/install.sh | bash`) before package-manager/manual alternatives.
- **Removed old local installer guidance.** User-facing docs no longer advertise legacy local shell wrappers or Python-tool manager shortcuts. `pip install pythinker-code==0.16.0` remains as the universal Python fallback and release-gate snippet.
- **Aligned release artifact instructions.** Manual Windows, Linux package, and tarball sections all point at `0.16.0` GitHub Release assets and keep SHA-256 verification explicit.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.16.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.15.0 (2026-05-24)

### What changed in this release

- **Fixed `pythinker update` for curl-bash native installs.** Frozen onefile installs in `~/.local/bin/pythinker` are now detected as native even when older tarballs do not include the `.pythinker-native` sentinel, avoiding the broken `pythinker -m pip install --upgrade pythinker-code` path.
- **Added Unix native archive updating.** Linux and Apple Silicon macOS native builds now download the matching GitHub Release tarball, verify its `.sha256`, extract `pythinker`, and replace the current executable in place.
- **Improved native update guidance.** The update banner now shows the canonical fixed-version curl installer on Unix and keeps the Windows installer guidance for Windows native builds.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.15.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.14.0 (2026-05-24)

### What changed in this release

- **Install counter and README badge.** `https://pythinker.com/install.sh` and `https://pythinker.com/install.ps1` now route through a Cloudflare Worker-backed counter that records successful installer fetches and exposes both JSON and Shields-compatible badge endpoints. The README now shows the live install badge alongside PyPI downloads.
- **Canonical installer endpoint polish.** The hosted shell endpoint is the documented curl-bash path, the Windows PowerShell endpoint is documented as the native bootstrap, and pinned install examples now target `0.14.0` artifacts.
- **TUI activity and readability refinements.** Tool/agent headers use calmer grey styling, agent task names resolve at call time, live spinner rows stay pinned while status output clips, oversized output is capped, markdown rendering is cleaner, and shell activity indicators are more stable.
- **Release and CI hardening.** Plugin downloads are stricter, pythinker-home sync dispatch now skips when its optional repository-dispatch secret is absent instead of failing the main branch, and release documentation was refreshed for the native installer flow.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.14.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.13.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Native installers for macOS and Linux.** `brew install TechMatrix-labs/pythinker/pythinker-code` (Homebrew tap) covers both macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) and Linux brew installs from a single auto-generated formula. Debian/Ubuntu users get `pythinker-code_x.y.z_<arch>.deb` and Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE users get `pythinker-code-x.y.z.<arch>.rpm`, both attached to every GitHub Release for `x86_64` and `aarch64`. Together with the Windows `PythinkerSetup-x.y.z.exe` shipped in 0.12.0, Pythinker now ships native installers for every supported platform — no Python, Node, or `uv` prerequisite.
- **Cross-OS curl-bash native installer.** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechMatrix-labs/pythinker-code/main/scripts/install-native.sh | bash` detects your OS + arch, downloads the matching PyInstaller-frozen tarball from the latest Release, verifies its SHA-256, and lands the binary at `~/.local/bin/pythinker`. Supports `linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, and `macos-arm64`. Honors `--version`, `--prefix`, and `NO_COLOR`.
- **Homebrew tap auto-published on every release.** A new `.github/workflows/homebrew-tap.yml` waits for the PyPI publish to land, runs an in-tree formula generator (replaces the unmaintained `homebrew-pypi-poet` — see release notes for the why), and pushes `Formula/pythinker-code.rb` to the `homebrew-pythinker` tap repo. 132 transitive deps are enumerated automatically — no hand-curation per release.
- **Tag-triggered Linux package pipeline.** A new `.github/workflows/linux-installer.yml` matrix-builds `.deb` and `.rpm` for `x86_64` and `aarch64` (the latter via QEMU on `ubuntu-latest`), then uploads all six artifacts to the GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`.
- **Frozen-binary data-files fix.** The PyInstaller specs for both the Windows and Linux pipelines now call `collect_data_files(pkg, include_py_files=False)` per package, so `pythinker_code/prompts/*.md`, `agents/default/*.yaml`, `tools/*/description.md`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, and similar package resources are bundled into `_internal/`. Without this fix the frozen binary crashed the first time it tried to load `init.md` or an agent yaml. The Windows installer that shipped in 0.12.0 is affected; users on that build should upgrade to 0.13.0.
- **Legacy install paths deprecated.** `scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`, `uvx pythinker-code`, `uv tool install pythinker-code`, `pipx install pythinker-code`, and bare `pip install pythinker-code` continue to work for existing automation. The two helper scripts now print a `[DEPRECATED]` banner at startup, pause 3 s, and point at the OS-specific native installer; set `PYTHINKER_INSTALL_QUIET_DEPRECATION=1` to suppress the banner. README Quick Start now leads with the per-OS install table.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.13.0`, or use the native installer for your OS (see the README install table).

## 0.12.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Native Windows installer.** A signed `PythinkerSetup-x.y.z.exe` is now attached to every GitHub Release — install Pythinker on Windows with one download, no Python / Node / uv prerequisite. The wizard installs per-user (no UAC) into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Pythinker`, registers `pythinker` on the user PATH, and broadcasts `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` so new shells pick the change up immediately. Uninstall reverses the PATH edit. Code-signing is wired through `signtool` and ships unsigned until the Authenticode cert lands; from that point forward the same CI job produces signed installers with no code change required.
- **In-app updates for the native build.** `pythinker update` from a native install detects the build (via a `.pythinker-native` sentinel next to `pythinker.exe`), fetches the latest GitHub Release asset, verifies its SHA-256, and re-runs the installer silently (`/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART`). The `PYTHINKER_CLI_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` opt-out env var that the PyPI path already honors now also gates the native auto-update path — one knob, both flows. The update banner shows a human-readable `PythinkerSetup-x.y.z.exe` line instead of leaking internal markers.
- **Tag-triggered Windows build pipeline.** A new `.github/workflows/windows-installer.yml` runs on every `pythinker-code-v*` tag, freezes `pythinker` via PyInstaller (`--onedir` for faster startup and fewer AV false positives), compiles the Inno Setup script, signs the result if `WINDOWS_CERT_PFX_BASE64` / `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` secrets are populated, and uploads the `.exe` plus its `.sha256` to the corresponding Release.
- **Shell terminal rhythm refinements.** Tone tokens, motion timing, and theme palette were retuned (sky-blue `#7dd3fc` / `#93c5fd` accents) so transcript rows, motion status, and dialog surfaces breathe consistently. UI snapshot tests updated to lock the new rhythm in place.

Upgrade with `pythinker update`, `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.12.0`, or — on Windows — download `PythinkerSetup-0.12.0.exe` from the Releases page.

## 0.11.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Fixed PyPI install conflict (was failing on Windows and every other platform).** `pip install pythinker-code==0.10.0` failed with `fastmcp 3.2.0 depends on mcp<2.0 and >=1.24.0` vs `pythinker-core 1.1.0 depends on mcp<1.17 and >=1`. 0.11.0 pins the republished `pythinker-core 1.1.1`, whose widened `mcp>=1.23,<2` constraint lets the resolver pick a single `mcp` version compatible with `fastmcp==3.2.0`.
- **Blackbox-style TUI port — phase 1.** Shell design primitives, compact transcript activity rows, blackbox-style motion status, standardized shell dialogs, aligned footer status styling, and a restyled tool-result surface land together. The TUI now shares a coherent visual language across rows, dialogs, and motion.
- **Refreshed TUI accent palette.** Dark/light theme accent retuned to a cleaner sky-blue (`#7dd3fc` dark, `#0284c7` light) for better contrast against the new tool-result surfaces.
- **Markdown + report polish.** Report spacing and markdown code blocks render with improved breathing room and consistent fences.
- **Rotating thinking-word indicator restored** with a leading space before the live stream status so the spinner no longer abuts surrounding text.
- **Internal audit + smoke evaluation.** A blackbox TUI scope map, prompt/agent audit, and a recorded visual smoke evaluation join the repo to govern future TUI work.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.11.0`.

## 0.10.0 (2026-05-22)

### What changed in this release

- **Tool failure recovery improvements.** The agent loop now handles malformed or empty tool-call responses more gracefully and can continue the session instead of leaving the UI stuck after a bad provider turn.
- **Safer file edits.** File write and replace tools now create restore points before mutating files, giving sessions a clearer recovery path after risky changes.
- **Session UX state tracking.** Runtime session state now records additional UX metadata so shell surfaces can provide better continuity across long-running work.
- **Shell command enhancements.** New shell slash-command plumbing improves discoverability and keeps interactive workflows smoother.
- **TUI renderer polish.** Tool cards now share more consistent status glyphs, truncation behavior, and result summaries across bash, read, write, edit, grep, find, web, subagent, background, ask-user, and think renderers.
- **Clipboard handling hardening.** Clipboard helpers now degrade more cleanly when platform clipboard access is unavailable.
- **Release and TUI specs.** The repository now includes the blackbox TUI port design and a visual smoke-test criterion for future terminal UI work.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.10.0`.

## 0.9.0 (2026-05-21)

### What changed in this release

- **Cleaner TUI — tool card backgrounds removed.** The grey pending/running
  background overlay that appeared behind every tool execution card (subagents,
  bash executions, reads, etc.) has been removed. Only user-message blocks
  retain a background tint, keeping the visual hierarchy focused on your input.
- **Welcome screen enhancements.** The startup info panel now shows the current
  git branch (when inside a git repo) and the session auto-save path alongside
  the working directory and session ID. Branch name is highlighted in magenta
  for quick scanning.
- **Bash header strip styling.** The `$ command` portion of bash execution
  headers now picks up the `tool_pending_bg` token for the strip background,
  matching the reference renderer style and providing consistent visual weight
  across themes.
- **Pythinker markdown renderer wired into message components.** User messages,
  assistant messages, and custom messages now render through `pythinker_markdown`
  (the project's own Markdown renderer) instead of raw `rich.markdown.Markdown`,
  giving consistent heading, code-block, and table styling everywhere.
- **Expanded theme palette.** `theme.py` gains a full `MarkdownColors` /
  `markdown_rich_style` subsystem with dark and light palettes covering headings,
  emphasis, inline code, links, blockquotes, table borders, code-block borders
  and backgrounds, and spinner states (active/done/failed).
- **Improved tool fallback renderers.** The call fallback now emits a
  status-glyph header (`✔`/`✘`/`●`) instead of a bare label. The result
  fallback now truncates long outputs at 60 lines / 4000 chars with an
  italicised note (matching the card renderer's behaviour), and applies the
  correct theme tokens for error vs. muted output.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.9.0`.

## 0.8.0 (2026-05-21)

Version-scheme reset. `pythinker-code` now ships as `0.8.0` under the new
`0.MINOR.PATCH` line.

### What changed in this release

- **Version line reset.** `pyproject.toml` `version` is `0.8.0` under the new release design.
  All prior `pythinker-code` 1.x/2.x releases have been yanked from PyPI and
  removed from the GitHub Releases page. New installs of
  `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.8.0` resolve to the `0.x` line.
- **Tag scheme standardised** on `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`. The
  `release-pythinker-cli.yml` workflow trigger now matches `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`
  and `scripts/check_version_tag.py` strips the leading `v` before comparing the
  tag to `pyproject.toml`.
- **Release gate preserved.** The `What's New in <version>` section,
  `pythinker-code==<version>` install snippet, and `## <version> (YYYY-MM-DD)`
  CHANGELOG entry are still required for every tag — only the version values
  change.
- **CHANGELOG restart.** Pre-`0.8.0` history archived to
  `docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md`; this file starts fresh at `0.8.0`.
- **README "What's New" trimmed.** The cascading 2.x "What's New" wall is
  replaced by a single `0.8.0` section. Past release notes live in the archived
  CHANGELOG and the per-tag GitHub Releases (from `v0.8.0` onward).
- **Test refactor.** `tests/telemetry/test_otel_resource.py` now reads the
  expected service version from `importlib.metadata.version("pythinker-code")`
  instead of a hard-coded string, so future version bumps don't require a test
  edit.

### Included in 0.8.0

All functionality included in `pythinker-code` 0.8.0 is preserved:
review-first workflows (`pythinker review`, `pythinker secscan`,
`pythinker security-scan`, `pythinker debug`), Reviewflow stateful
review/fix workflows, the new `code-reviewer` / `security-reviewer` /
`debugger` subagent roles, hardened review-output validation, and the
read-only PR artifact helpers (`describe`, `improve` / `suggest`, `ask`,
`labels`, `changelog`, `docs`, `compliance`, etc.).

See [`docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md`](docs/history/CHANGELOG-pre-0.8.0.md)
for the archived pre-reset release-by-release notes.

Upgrade with `pythinker update` or `pip install --upgrade pythinker-code==0.8.0`.
